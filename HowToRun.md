To run the federated learning project for stock prediction using the ARIMA model, you'll need to set up your environment with the necessary dependencies and configure your project correctly. Below are the steps, including the code for installing dependencies and running the project.

### 1. **Project Dependencies**

Hereâ€™s a list of the required dependencies:

- Python 3.8+
- Flask (for the web server and frontend)
- requests (for HTTP requests between server and clients)
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- statsmodels (for ARIMA model)
- numpy (for numerical operations)

You can install all the dependencies using `pip`. Create a `requirements.txt` file:

```plaintext
Flask==2.3.2
requests==2.31.0
pandas==2.0.3
statsmodels==0.14.0
numpy==1.25.1
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

To install all the dependencies, navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the required Python packages.

### 3. **Running the Server**

Navigate to the `server` directory and run the server:

```bash
python server.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 4. **Running the Clients**

Each client represents a different node in the federated learning setup. You need to run these clients on different machines or separate processes.

#### Example for Running Client Node 1:

```bash
python client_node1.py
```

Similarly, run `client_node2.py` and `client_node3.py` in separate terminals or machines.

### 5. **Running the Frontend**

Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the Flask app:

```bash
python app.py
```

The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 6. **Configuring the IP Addresses**

In your `client_nodeX.py` files, make sure to replace `server_ip` with the actual IP address or hostname of the server where `server.py` is running. If the server is running on the same machine, you can use `localhost`.

For example, in `client_node1.py`:

```python
response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/send_model', json={"model_params": local_model_params.tolist()})
```

### 7. **Setting Up the Data**

You need to download and place your datasets in the `data/` directory.

- Download the **Google Stock Price Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehallmar/google-stock-price-dataset).
- Split the dataset into three parts: `stock_data_node1.csv`, `stock_data_node2.csv`, and `stock_data_node3.csv`.

Each client script will use one of these files to train a local ARIMA model.

### 8. **Running the Full Project**

1. **Start the Server**: Run `server.py` in the server directory.
2. **Run the Clients**: Run `client_node1.py`, `client_node2.py`, and `client_node3.py`.
3. **Use the Frontend**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

### 9. **Testing the Application**

- **Upload Data**: Use the upload interface in the frontend to upload datasets (if not already provided to the clients).
- **Predict**: Use the predict interface to trigger predictions and see the results.

### 10. **Troubleshooting**

If you encounter any issues:

- Ensure all dependencies are installed.
- Check the server and client logs for any errors.
- Ensure IP addresses are correctly configured.
- Verify that the datasets are correctly formatted.

This setup should allow you to run the federated learning project for stock prediction using the ARIMA model. The provided code is a starting point and can be extended with additional features like more sophisticated models, secure communication between server and clients, and a more user-friendly frontend.
